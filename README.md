# ‚ßó AsyncStatus

> **Modern status updates for async teams**

AsyncStatus is a lightweight, developer-friendly platform that helps distributed teams stay synchronized without the overhead of constant meetings or status check-ins. Track progress, identify blockers, and share updates across multiple interfaces - CLI, web app, and Slack.

## üöÄ Why AsyncStatus?

**The Problem:** Remote and async teams struggle with visibility. Daily standups interrupt flow, Slack updates get lost, and managers lack insight into team progress and blockers.

**The Solution:** AsyncStatus provides structured, async status updates that integrate seamlessly into existing workflows:

- **Developers** can update status from the terminal without context switching
- **Teams** get visibility into progress and blockers without meetings  
- **Managers** see real-time team health and can unblock work faster
- **Everyone** stays informed without notification overload

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üñ•Ô∏è CLI-First:** Git-style interface for developers (`asyncstatus edit` works like `git rebase -i`)
- **üåê Web Dashboard:** Rich editor with team views and analytics
- **üí¨ Slack Integration:** Native slash commands and channel notifications
- **üìä Progress Tracking:** Track completed tasks, work in progress, and blockers
- **üòä Mood & Context:** Optional mood tracking and detailed notes
- **üìÖ Time-Aware:** Natural date parsing ("yesterday", "3 days ago")
- **üîê Team-Ready:** Multi-team support with proper authentication

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This is a **TypeScript monorepo** built with modern tooling:

```
asyncstatus/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/           # Hono API server (Cloudflare Workers)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cli/           # Go CLI application
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web-app/       # React dashboard (Vite + TanStack Router)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ marketing-app/ # Next.js marketing site
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/            # Shared React components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ editor/        # Rich text editor for status updates
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email/         # Email templates
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *-config/      # Shared configs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Package manager: Bun
```
