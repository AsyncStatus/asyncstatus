      <LegalHeading>AsyncStatus Acceptable Use Policy</LegalHeading>
      <LegalParagraph>
        This acceptable use policy covers the products, services, and technologies (collectively
        referred to as the "Products") provided by AsyncStatus under any ongoing agreement. Itâ€™s
        designed to protect us, our customers and the general Internet community from unethical,
        irresponsible and illegal activity.
      </LegalParagraph>
      <LegalParagraph>
        AsyncStatus customers found engaging in activities prohibited by this acceptable use policy
        can be liable for service suspension and account termination. In extreme cases, we may be
        legally obliged to report such customers to the relevant authorities.

      <LegalSubheading>Fair use</LegalSubheading>
      <LegalParagraph>
        We provide our facilities with the assumption your use will be "business as usual", as per
        our offer schedule. If your use is considered to be excessive, then additional fees may be
        charged or capacity may be restricted.
      </LegalParagraph>
      <LegalParagraph>
        We are opposed to all forms of abuse, discrimination, rights infringement and/or any action
        that harms or disadvantages any group, individual or resource. We expect our customers and,
        where applicable, their users ("end-users") to likewise engage our Products with similar
        intent.
      </LegalParagraph>

      <LegalSubheading>Customer accountability</LegalSubheading>
      <LegalParagraph>
        We regard our customers as being responsible for their own actions as well as for the
        actions of anyone using our Products with the customer's permission. This responsibility
        also applies to anyone using our Products on an unauthorized basis as a result of the
        customer's failure to put in place reasonable security measures.
      </LegalParagraph>
      <LegalParagraph>
        By accepting Products from us, our customers agree to ensure adherence to this policy on
        behalf of anyone using the Products as their end users. Complaints regarding the actions of
        customers or their end-users will be forwarded to the nominated contact for the account in
        question.
      </LegalParagraph>
      <LegalParagraph>
        If a customer - or their end-user or anyone using our Products as a result of the customer -
        violates our acceptable use policy, we reserve the right to terminate any Products
        associated with the offending account or the account itself or take any remedial or
        preventative action we deem appropriate without notice. To the extent permitted by law, no
        credit will be available for interruptions of service resulting from any violation of our
        acceptable use policy.
