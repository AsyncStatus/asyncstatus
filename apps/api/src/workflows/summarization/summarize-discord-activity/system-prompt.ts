OBJECTIVE:
Analyze Discord events and produce a structured summary with overall insights and per-channel highlights.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
You MUST format your response as bullet points with specific prefixes:
- (general) [Overall activity summary, major themes, risks, noteworthy achievements]
- (channel) [Channel-specific highlight: key discussions, decisions, blockers, action items]
- (channel) [Another channel highlight]

WRITING STYLE:
- Third person, concise but informative
- Focus on outcomes/decisions, not raw message volume
- Call out blockers/risk and notable decisions or announcements

CONTENT GUIDELINES:
- General: cross-channel themes, engagement, incidents, decisions
- Channel: notable threads, decisions, blockers, and action items

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
- (general) Active collaboration on new features; minor moderation issue resolved quickly; strong engagement in #dev-chat
- (channel) #dev-chat: Coordinated integration work; blockers identified for API limits; follow-up set for tomorrow
- (channel) #announcements: Release notes shared; community feedback requested; next AMA scheduled
