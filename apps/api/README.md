## GitLab Integration

To enable GitLab integration, you need to create a GitLab OAuth application and configure it properly:

1. Go to your GitLab profile settings > Applications
2. Click "New application"
3. Fill in the following details:
   - Name: AsyncStatus (or your preferred name)
   - Redirect URI: `https://your-api-domain.com/integrations/gitlab/callback`

4. Note the Application ID and Secret
5. Update your environment variables:
   ```
   GITLAB_CLIENT_ID=your_application_id
   GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_application_secret
   GITLAB_INSTANCE_URL=https://gitlab.com (or your GitLab instance URL)
   GITLAB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
   ```

### Webhook Configuration

The GitLab integration automatically sets up webhooks for all projects when syncing. Webhooks are configured to send the following events:

- **Push events**: Code pushes, branch creation/deletion
- **Issue events**: Issue creation, updates, comments
- **Merge request events**: MR creation, updates, comments
- **Pipeline events**: CI/CD pipeline status changes
- **Job events**: Build job status changes
- **Deployment events**: Deployment status changes
- **Wiki events**: Wiki page changes
- **Release events**: Release creation/updates

### Webhook Security

Webhooks are secured using a shared secret token. The `GITLAB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable should be a strong, random string that matches what's configured in GitLab.

After installation, your GitLab integration will allow users to connect their GitLab organizations to AsyncStatus, providing access to repository data, team information, and real-time activity updates through webhooks.
